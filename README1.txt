Portfolio Project: Flatmate Rent Calculator
Description

This is a web application developed using Python and Flask that helps flatmates calculate how much they need to pay for rent based on the total monthly rent and the number of days they stayed in the apartment during that month. It simplifies the process of splitting rent expenses between flatmates based on their occupancy.
Features

    Calculate Rent: The app allows flatmates to input the total monthly rent and the number of days each flatmate stayed in the apartment during the billing month.
    Fair Share Calculation: The app calculates the fair share of rent for each flatmate based on their occupancy days.
    User-Friendly Interface: The web app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for an effortless rent calculation process.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Flask (Install using pip install Flask)


Lessons Learned

During the development of this portfolio project, I gained valuable experience and learned several key lessons:

    Python and Flask Basics: I deepened my understanding of Python and the Flask web framework. I now feel more confident in building web applications using Python.

    Web Application Development: I learned the fundamentals of web application development, including handling HTTP requests, rendering templates, and managing routes in Flask.

    User Input and Data Handling: I explored how to handle user input and process data in the backend. This project taught me how to retrieve data from users, validate input, and perform calculations based on the provided data.


    Deployment Considerations: I gained insight into deploying web applications in a production environment. This includes selecting appropriate WSGI servers, handling static files, and configuring reverse proxies.

    ReadMe and Documentation: Creating this ReadMe file taught me how to document a project effectively. Clear and concise documentation is essential for users and contributors to understand the project and its purpose.

    Problem-Solving Skills: This project challenged me to think critically and solve real-world problems related to rent splitting between flatmates. It enhanced my ability to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and implement solutions efficiently.

    Continuous Learning: Throughout the project, I realized that software development is a continuous learning journey. There's always something new to discover and improve upon, and each project presents an opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills.
